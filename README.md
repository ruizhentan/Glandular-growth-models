# Glandular-growth-models
These are the two libraries to simulate fission growth and invasive growth in glandular tumours. 
Growth can be simulated for a single cluster of resistant cells at varying distance from the center of the tumour or for two clusters at the left and right of the 
center of the tumour. 
AT refers to adaptive therapy, whereas CT refers to continuous therapy.
